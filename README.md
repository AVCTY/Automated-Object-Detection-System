# Automated Object Detection System
<p align="justify">
  This project was made to develop a web based system for a client to monitor the conveyor belt in the factory for a cement bag manufacturer.
  The system's capabilites are to detect and count the multiple types of cement bags being manufactured, and to also identify any faulty bags 
  or irregularities on the conveyor belt.

  The system is also responsible for showing a dashbord that tracks the production count of the cement bags according to the selected time 
  frame, and keep track and calculate the daily commissions of the current assigned workers daily.
